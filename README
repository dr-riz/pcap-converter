Description
====================
This tool converts pcap file to textual netflows that is inclusive of TCP conversations [pcap-to-flow.py]. It does this by hacking together Team AppNeta's and Wang's works that respectively captures TCP Conversation Streams and converts to textual netflows.

Team AppNeta's work is posted at: https://www.appneta.com/blog/how-to-easily-capture-tcp-conversation-streams/

I did quick testing on fuzz-2006-07-05-6279.pcap, a sample file of around 7mb from https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/captures/ 

flow format
--------------------
0.00151 72.251.163.69 46514 163.80.218.80 54782 TCP 54 1 0.013423
<start time stamp> <src ip> <src port> <dst ip> <dst port> <protocol> <flow size> <num packets> <flow duration>

Dependency

You can install tshark easily in ubuntu

sudo apt-get install tshark


Usage
=====================

    $ ./pcap-to-flow.py -p dosattack.pcap -t 0.01

This will create 3 files: (1) full_conv_dosattack.pcap, (2) full_conv_dosattack_tshark.txt, and (3) full_conv_dosattack.flow

(3) is the required file.

Type the following commands for more help
    
    $ ./pcap-to-flow.py -h
