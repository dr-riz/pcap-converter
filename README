Description
====================
This tool converts pcap file to textual netflows that is inclusive of full TCP conversations -- any incomplete TCP handshakes are filtered out. It does this by hacking together Team AppNeta's and Wang's works that, respectively, captures TCP Conversation Streams, and converts them to textual netflows for a given timeout period.

Team AppNeta's work is posted at: https://www.appneta.com/blog/how-to-easily-capture-tcp-conversation-streams/

I did quick testing on fuzz-2006-07-05-6279.pcap, a sample file of around 7mb from https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/captures/ 

flow format
--------------------
0.00151 72.251.163.69 46514 163.80.218.80 54782 TCP 54 1 0.013423

Dependency

You can install tshark easily in ubuntu

sudo apt-get install tshark


Usage
=====================

    $ ./pcap-to-flow.py -p dosattack.pcap -t 0.01

where '-t' is the timeout session in seconds, and lower number goes more closed sessions. This will create 4 files: (1) full_conv_dosattack.pcap, (2) full_conv_dosattack_tshark.txt, (3) full_conv_dosattack.flow.csv, and (4) dosattack.pcap.skipped

(3) is the required file with full TCP conversations. It also includes UDP, LDAP and other layer-4 protocols.
(4) contains the skipped entries. It usually contains low-level protocols.

========== Summary ========== 
total packets = 100, exported flows = 41. open flows = 59, skipped = 0
text to flow converted with full tcp conv: full_conv_dosattack.flow.csv
skipped packet metadata in: dosattack.pcap.skipped
Type the following commands for more help
    
    $ ./pcap-to-flow.py -h

TODO
====================
	- scope the timeout to connection-oriented or TCP-like protocols
	- clean up code
	- write unit tests
